## Robot Motion Planning

This repo contains motion planning algorithms for two different systems: a planar robot arm, and a simple steered car. 

I solve the first problem by using a k-PRM algorithm, and the second by using a Rapidly-exploring Random tree. 

The problems and solutions are discussed in great detail in motion-planning.pdf. 

### To Run

You can run the two solutions in Eclipse by simply running ```RobotArmDriver``` or ```RobotCarDriver```.
